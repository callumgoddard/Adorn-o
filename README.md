# Adorn-o

This is the python implementation of Adorn-o. It is offered as is, with no support provided.


## Requirements
 
 - MacOS is required as a pre-compiled version of melcov is used. For different operating systems the melconv binary files can likely be replaced with the correctly compiled version, but this has not been tested.
 - Python 2.7 (an update to python 3 is in the works)
 - R 3.2.1 to run the rpy2
 - rpy2 version 2.8.6
 - pyguitarpro - https://github.com/Perlence/PyGuitarPro/releases/tag/v0.5
 - synpy (provided but sourced from: https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/syncopation-dataset/repository/show/synpy)
 - scipy, numpy
 - and likely a few more more....


## Setup

As (currently) not requirements.txt is provided, running `test_all.py` will run the unit tests for Adorn-o, all the main functions are called and the errors produced will highlight what packages you need to have installed.
